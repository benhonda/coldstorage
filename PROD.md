# ColdStorage — Going to Prod (multi-user) — Design & Delivery Plan

> The SSOT for taking ColdStorage from **single-operator dogfooding** to **real downloaded, paying,
> multi-user prod**. Read [`README.md`](./README.md) first for what's already built/proven. This doc
> owns the *new* surface: identity, per-user storage isolation, zero-knowledge keys, billing, distribution.
> Decisions here were locked with Ben on 2026-06-29; don't re-litigate them, refine the *how*.

## Decisions in force (locked 2026-06-29)
- **Distribution: direct download, Developer ID + notarization.** NOT the Mac App Store — its App Sandbox
  would break our daemon + unix-socket + FSEvents + watch-any-folder architecture, and it mandates Apple
  IAP. We own updates + pricing, no Apple cut.
- **Billing: Paddle (Merchant of Record).** Paddle is the legal seller — handles global VAT/sales tax,
  chargebacks, invoicing. We integrate their checkout + webhooks; we are not the merchant of record.
- **Encryption: true zero-knowledge, user-derived keys.** We cannot read user bytes. **Forces a recovery
  mechanism** (a one-time recovery code) — with passwordless auth (below) the recovery code is the ONLY
  human-held encryption secret, so it is **non-optional** and the whole ZK story rests on it.
- **Auth: Cognito, PASSWORDLESS (revised by Ben 2026-07-02; was email/password + Apple).** **Google IdP
  is the primary login** + Cognito **native email-OTP codes** as the no-Google path (Essentials tier;
  NOT magic links — those aren't Cognito-native and aren't worth custom auth Lambdas). **No passwords
  anywhere in the product.** Apple IdP stays var-gated off for later (direct download = no App Store
  mandate to offer it). Infra: `cognito.tf` (`sign_in_policy` = PASSWORD+EMAIL_OTP — AWS refuses to
  remove PASSWORD from the pool-level list (apply error 2026-07-02); passwordless is enforced by the
  app client having no password flows AND OTP users never possessing a password — plus `ALLOW_USER_AUTH`
  client flow; Google IdP + hosted-UI domain LIVE as of 2026-07-02, smoke-tested to the Google redirect).
- **One shared vault bucket, per-user prefix isolation** (not per-user buckets — those hit account caps).

## Architecture

### Identity & AWS credentials (verified vs aws-sdk-swift + Cognito IAM docs, 2026-06-29)
- **Cognito User Pool** = authentication (passwordless: Google IdP + email-OTP; Apple gated off). Issues a user-pool ID token.
- **Cognito Identity Pool** = authorization → exchanges that ID token for **short-lived STS credentials**
  via `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`, assuming the **authenticated IAM role** below.
- **The daemon never holds a long-lived AWS key.** aws-sdk-swift ships a turnkey
  **`CognitoAWSCredentialIdentityResolver`** (`AWSSDKIdentity`): given `identityPoolId` + `logins`
  (the user-pool token) it fetches/caches/refreshes temp creds and exposes `updateLogins(...)` for
  re-auth. It plugs straight into `S3Client.S3ClientConfig(awsCredentialIdentityResolver:region:)`.
  → replaces the 3 default-chain `S3ClientConfiguration(region:)` sites. The pipeline is untouched.

### Per-user S3 isolation (the load-bearing security boundary)
- The authenticated IAM role's S3 policy scopes every action to **`blobs/${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}/*`**.
  AWS substitutes the caller's identity id at eval time, so user A's temp creds **physically cannot**
  read/write user B's objects. This is the AWS-documented pattern (`cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub`
  policy variable) and it is the *entire* cross-user boundary — it must be adversarially tested (try to
  GET/PUT another sub's prefix with a real token and confirm `AccessDenied`).
- **S3 key layout changes:** `blobs/<hash>` → **`blobs/<cognito-sub>/<hash>`**. The daemon prefixes every
  blob key with the caller's identity id (resolved once at startup from the resolver / a `whoami` call),
  or the policy variable has nothing to match. Ripples to: upload key construction, restore GET, and the
  journal's `s3Key` column. Journal stays per-install (local), so the sub-prefix is recorded in `s3Key`.

### Zero-knowledge key hierarchy (refines the existing envelope crypto)
Our crypto is **already** envelope encryption — `Crypto.swift`: a per-blob random **DEK** (AES-256-GCM)
encrypts frames; the DEK is stored **wrapped** under a KEK in the journal `blobs.wrappedDEK` column;
`KeyProvider` is just `func userKEK() throws -> SymmetricKey`. ZK swaps *what produces the KEK*. A proper
hierarchy (1Password/Bitwarden-style) keeps the DEKs stable under any secret rotation — and with
**passwordless auth (2026-07-02) the password leg is RETIRED**: the recovery code is the only human-held
secret, wrapping the MK alone (recovery-code-only model, the old "option (b)"):

```
recovery code ─Argon2id(salt_rc)─▶ KEK_rc ──▶ unwrap ──▶  MasterKey (MK, random, per-user, never leaves device decrypted)
                                                                │
server stores ONLY:  wrappedMK_rc + salt                        ├──wraps──▶ per-blob DEKs  (journal.wrappedDEK, byte-identical to today)
(ciphertext; server/AWS never see MK or the code)               ▼
                                            DEK ──▶ AES-256-GCM frames ──▶ S3 (Deep Archive)

each signed-in device: MK cached in the macOS Keychain (per-device escrow — no prompt at launch)
```

- **MK** is a random 256-bit key minted once at signup. It is the `userKEK()` the wrap/unwrap code already
  expects — so `wrap()`/`unwrap()`/`blobCrypto`/UploadEngine/RestoreEngine are **unchanged**.
- The MK is stored **once, wrapped under `KEK_rc`** (Argon2id of the one-time recovery code); ciphertext +
  salt live **server-side** — the encrypted **key-blob**, the only new server-stored secret material, and
  it's zero-knowledge (we hold ciphertext only). A **new device** fetches the key-blob and unwraps it with
  the recovery code — day-to-day devices never re-enter it (Keychain-cached MK).
- **Recovery-code reissue** = any signed-in device (it holds MK) mints a new code and re-wraps: new
  `wrappedMK_rc` + salt to the server. DEKs untouched, no re-encryption of data — the same stability the
  old password-change path had.
- **Recovery code** = shown once at signup. Lose the code AND all signed-in devices = data is
  unrecoverable *by design* (honest ZK; we never claim we can recover it).
- New `KeyProvider` impl: **`UserMasterKeyProvider`** — **built** (Phase 3; Argon2id via swift-sodium,
  decided 2026-07-01). Its primitives support BOTH a password path and a recovery-code path (both tested);
  passwordless simply leaves the pw path unused — no rework, the `wrappedMK_pw` slot just stays empty.
- **Cross-device** now genuinely needs the server-side index (the deferred R2/portability piece): the
  wrapped MK + the journal/manifest must be fetchable on a fresh install. ZK makes this load-bearing, not
  optional.

### Billing (Paddle MoR)
- Paddle-hosted checkout + customer portal (no card data touches us). **Webhooks** drive subscription
  lifecycle → our account backend flips `subscription_active`. Uploads are gated on an active sub.
- Retrieval fees: the existing `getPricing` rate card stays the quote SSOT; actual charging for restores
  is a later refinement (subscription-gates-storage first).

### Account backend (new)
- Minimal API linking **Cognito identity ↔ Paddle subscription ↔ the encrypted key-blob**. Responsibilities:
  (1) serve/store the wrapped-MK key-blob (ZK), (2) receive Paddle webhooks + expose `subscription_active`,
  (3) optionally broker the Cognito identity id. Stateless-ish; smallest thing that works — **decided in
  P4: Hono on Vercel + Neon/Drizzle** (not the originally-sketched Lambda+DynamoDB; see Phase 4).

### Distribution
- electron-builder already configured. Add: **Developer ID Application** cert + notarization
  (`mac.notarize: true` + Apple creds), confirm nested Swift binaries under `Contents/Resources/bin` are
  signed with hardened runtime, **auto-update** (electron-updater + the `zip` target already emitted), and
  a download page. The bundled `coldstored` keeps its `-sectcreate` Info.plist for the Photos grant.

## Delivery plan — phases, each with a proof gate
1. **Infra foundation — DONE ✅ + APPLIED (2026-06-30). Cognito is LIVE in prod.** Cognito User Pool (+ Apple
   IdP, var-gated off) + Identity Pool + **authenticated IAM role** scoped to
   `blobs/${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}/*`, in `infra/coldstorage/modules/stack/cognito.tf`
   (+ `variables.tf`/`outputs.tf`; committed in `8b25956`). *Gate met:* plan was **6 add / 0 change / 0
   destroy** (additive — untouched vault/daemon) with the **literal** `${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}`
   rendered (the `$${` escape), then **`terragrunt apply ENV=production` → `Apply complete! Resources: 6
   added`**. The user pool / client / identity pool / user-role exist in prod (`ca-central-1`). The public
   client ids (not secrets) are available via `cd infra/coldstorage/live/production && terragrunt output`;
   they'll flow to the daemon/app through the **gitignored handoff in 2c** — kept OUT of tracked docs
   (public repo).
2. **Daemon credential seam — DONE ✅ (2026-07-01, all 3 sub-steps landed).** Built in gated sub-steps:
   - **2a — per-user key as journal SSOT: DONE ✅ (2026-06-30, 71 Core tests green).** `keyPrefix` threads
     `BlobPlan`(`Models.swift`)→`BlobPlanner`→`UploadEngine.run(keyPrefix:)` to the real S3 PUT; it's stored
     as `s3Key`; **`RestoreEngine` reads the stored key** via new `Journal.blobS3Key(_:)` (the keystone fix —
     a `blobs/<cognito-id>/<id>` object is now found, not missed). Backward-compatible (default `"blobs"`);
     proven by `PerUserPrefixTests` (prefix reaches store + journal; default path unchanged).
   - **2b — DONE ✅ (2026-07-01, 72 Core tests green + `ui:typecheck`/`ui:test` green).** New `CognitoAuth`
     actor (`Sources/ColdStorageCore/CognitoAuth.swift`) owns a single long-lived
     `CognitoAWSCredentialIdentityResolver` (built once, unauthenticated, at init — the resolver makes no
     network call until something needs credentials, confirmed by reading the vendored SDK source, not just
     the docs); `authenticate(idToken:)` calls `updateLogins` on it (so `S3Client` — which holds a reference,
     not a copy — signs every later call as this user) and separately calls `CognitoIdentityClient.getId`
     (the resolver never exposes the identity id it resolves internally) to set
     `vaultPrefix = "blobs/\(identityId)"`. `coldstored/main.swift` is opt-in gated on 3 new env vars
     (`COLDSTORE_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`/`_USER_POOL_PROVIDER`/`_REGION`) — unset ⇒ today's default
     credential chain + `"blobs"`, byte-for-byte the old behavior; set ⇒ `S3Client` is built from
     `CognitoAuth.resolver`. `DaemonService` takes `cognitoAuth: CognitoAuth?` and `performRun` reads
     `await cognitoAuth?.vaultPrefix ?? "blobs"` into `engine.run(keyPrefix:)` — one edit point covers
     scheduled runs + both deposit paths (all three call `performRun`). New control command
     `authenticate idToken=…` (`DaemonService.handle`) → `AuthDTO{ok,identityId}`; errors clean on a daemon
     with no `cognitoAuth` configured. `protocol.ts` `Auth`/`authenticate` added (typecheck + `ui:test`
     green) — the login UI itself is still Phase 5. `CognitoAuthTests` proves the actor starts
     unauthenticated (`vaultPrefix == nil`) with no network call.
   - **2c — DONE ✅ (2026-07-01).** `tf:coldstorage:creds-export` now also emits
     `COLDSTORE_COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID` + `COLDSTORE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_PROVIDER` (composed from the
     already-applied `cognito_identity_pool_id`/`cognito_user_pool_id`/`aws_region` TF outputs — no new
     Terraform output needed, so no apply required for this sub-step) into the gitignored handoff. Both
     consumers read them: **`daemon:install`** substitutes 2 new plist placeholders
     (`__COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID__`/`__COGNITO_USER_POOL_PROVIDER__`) into
     `launchd/com.theadpharm.coldstored.plist.template`, blank when the handoff predates 2c; **`ui:config`**
     writes the same 2 values into the packaged app's `config.json`, read by `ui/src/main/daemon.ts`'s
     `AppConfig`/`daemonEnv` (same pass-through pattern as `bucket`/`region`/`awsProfile`) so the Electron-app
     daemon supervisor picks them up too. `coldstored/main.swift`'s gate now treats an **empty string** the
     same as unset (`nonEmpty(_:)`) — needed because the plist/config.json always set the keys now, blank
     when not configured, instead of omitting them. Verified: `daemon:build:dev` + `daemon:test` (72 green) +
     `ui:typecheck` + `ui:test` (51 green); all 3 new/changed shell blocks passed `bash -n`.

   Why **atomic** to actually upload as a user: the IAM policy only grants `blobs/<sub>/*`, so the credential
   swap (2b) and the per-user prefix (2a) must both be live or every PUT is `AccessDenied`. All of 2a/2b/2c
   are now live end-to-end (daemon wiring + the handoff that populates it) — what's left is a real Cognito
   user/token to actually exercise the path, which is Phase 5 (app auth UX) or a manually-minted token.
   *Gates:* unit test (a custom prefix round-trips; restore reads the stored key) + build green — **MET**.
   **LIVE gate — MET ✅ (2026-07-02).** Proven for real via the 5a app flow: Ben signed in with Google,
   deposited a file, and it landed at `blobs/<his-identityId>/…` in the production vault. The adversarial
   half is a repeatable task (`task daemon:gate-test`): it mints a throwaway second Cognito user, gets it
   real STS creds, and confirms own-prefix PUT is allowed while cross-prefix PUT AND a GET of Ben's real
   object both return `AccessDenied` — **GATE PASSED**. The per-user boundary holds against a real
   second identity, not just in theory.
3. **ZK crypto — primitives DONE ✅ (2026-07-01, 79 Core tests green).** New
   `Sources/ColdStorageCore/ZeroKnowledgeKeys.swift`: `KeyBlob` (wrappedMK under BOTH a password- and a
   recovery-code-derived Argon2id key, + their salts + the ops/mem tuning used, stored alongside since the
   raw KDF — unlike libsodium's self-describing `pwhash_str` — doesn't embed its params) and
   `ZeroKnowledgeKeys` (`mint`/`unlock`/`unlockWithRecoveryCode`/`rewrapPassword`/
   `resetPasswordUsingRecoveryCode`). MK is a random 256-bit key — the existing `userKEK()` `wrap()`/
   `unwrap()`/`EnvelopeCipher`/`UploadEngine`/`RestoreEngine` are byte-for-byte UNCHANGED, only what
   *produces* the KEK is new. `UserMasterKeyProvider: KeyProvider` is the drop-in production conformer
   (construction IS the unlock; a wrong secret throws `.wrongSecret` up front, never silently). **Argon2id
   library decided: swift-sodium** (wraps libsodium, which defaults `crypto_pwhash` to Argon2id) — chosen
   over `calebkleveter/Argon2` (unmaintained since 2018) and `Argon2Swift` (unmaintained since 2023, no
   Linux platform declared); verified against the actual vendored SDK/library source, not just docs.
   **Linux gotcha found + fixed:** Ubuntu 24.04's apt `libsodium-dev` is 1.0.18, which predates AEGIS
   (needs 1.0.19+) that swift-sodium's Linux binding references — build failed with "cannot find
   'crypto_aead_aegis128l_...'". Fixed by building current libsodium (1.0.22) from the official source
   release instead of apt (new `task daemon:setup` sub-task `_libsodium-dev`, Linux-only — Apple platforms
   get a prebuilt XCFramework bundled in the SPM package itself, no system lib needed). *Gate met:* unit
   tests — password change re-wraps MK without touching DEKs (proven: a DEK wrapped under MK before a
   password change still unwraps clean after, no re-encryption) ✅; recovery code unlocks (to the SAME MK
   as the password path) ✅; round-trip still byte-identical through the real `EnvelopeCipher` ✅; wrong
   password/recovery code fails closed (AES-GCM auth tag rejects, no silent garbage key) ✅; production
   Argon2id tuning (`defaultOpsLimit`/`defaultMemLimit`, libsodium's "Moderate" preset) verified to
   actually derive a key in this environment (~1.4s), not just the lightened test tuning ✅.
   **NOT yet wired into `coldstored/main.swift`** (unlike Phase 2's `CognitoAuth`) — there's nowhere
   legitimate to source a `KeyBlob` from yet (Phase 4, the account backend) or a password/recovery code
   from (Phase 5, the sign-in UI), so wiring it now would have no real caller. That wiring is now this
   phase's remaining work, landing naturally with P4/P5.
4. **Account backend — GATE MET ✅ (2026-07-02, staging lane): Paddle-simulator webhook flipped
   `subscriptionActive` in the staging Neon DB, both confirmed by Ben.** Staging is deployed and
   verified live at `https://api-staging.coldstorage.sh` (health + 400-on-unsigned-webhook +
   401-on-tokenless routes smoke-tested). What's deliberately left of P4 is only the **production
   lane** — live Paddle account, prod Neon branch, prod secrets, first production deploy — which
   nothing blocks on until Phase 5/6 need it. History below. Stack decided with Ben: **Hono on
   Vercel + Neon/Drizzle** (not Lambda+DynamoDB) — Vercel-project infra is already the adpharm-stack
   convention (`references/terraform.md`), Neon is that convention's DB default, and this needed no AWS
   SDK/credentials at runtime (Cognito ID-token verification is a plain JWKS check), so the daemon's
   `aws-oidc.md` credential dance doesn't apply here. New `account-backend/` (Taskfile `backend:*`):
   `accountsTable` (Drizzle, one row per Cognito **User Pool** `sub` — NOT the Identity Pool identity id
   S3 keys are prefixed with, see cognito.tf; this service never touches S3) holds the `KeyBlob` fields
   verbatim (base64 text — blind ciphertext storage, never decoded here) + `subscriptionActive` +
   Paddle customer/subscription ids. Routes: `GET/PUT /key-blob` (Cognito-ID-token-authenticated, via
   `aws-jwt-verify`'s `CognitoJwtVerifier`), `GET /entitlement` (`{active: bool}`), `POST /webhooks/paddle`
   (`@paddle/paddle-node-sdk`'s `webhooks.unmarshal` HMAC-verifies `paddle-signature`; a subscription is
   linked to a user via `customData.cognitoSub`, which the Paddle checkout must set — Paddle.js
   `customData` param, still TODO wherever checkout gets built in P5). Subscription status → `active`
   mapped by `isActiveStatus` (`active`/`trialing` → true), the one piece with a real unit test
   (`paddle-status.test.ts`) since everything else needs a live DB/Cognito/Paddle to exercise.
   **`bun run typecheck` + `bun test` green.** Infra: new `infra/account-backend/` (Taskfile
   `tf:account-backend:*`) mirrors `infra/coldstorage`'s Terragrunt layout but — unlike coldstorage,
   which deliberately opted OUT of the Vercel convention — this IS the Vercel app, so it gets the OIDC
   role + TF-managed env vars in full. The Cognito user-pool id/client-id are read via a cross-component
   Terragrunt `dependency` on `infra/coldstorage/live/production` (SSOT — no hand-copying `terragrunt
   output` values). Vercel project **created — `coldstorage-account-backend`** (`prj_IhOlkinKj2zIuHQ
   BBTJhdP7s008w`, verified via the Vercel API to confirm the name matches exactly what the OIDC trust
   condition expects), wired into `live/production/terragrunt.hcl`. **`terragrunt plan` is clean against
   real AWS + Vercel providers for BOTH stacks** (production `9 to add`; staging `10 to add`) — also
   confirmed the account's `oidc.vercel.com/adpharm` OIDC provider and the `/adpharm/vercel-api-token-
   benhonda` SSM param already exist (an open question going in; now resolved). Custom domains DECIDED
   (2026-07-02): **`api.coldstorage.sh`** (production) / **`api-staging.coldstorage.sh`** (staging
   custom environment). `coldstorage.sh` is registered with its nameservers delegated to Vercel DNS
   (`ns1/ns2.vercel-dns.com`). **Deliberately NOT Terraform-managed** — Ben manages the domains by
   hand in the Vercel dashboard (his experience: mixing Vercel-DNS-hosted domains with the Vercel TF
   provider is a mess). A `vercel_project_domain` version was built + plan-verified (1 to add per
   stack, staging bound via `custom_environment_id`) then reverted on that call — don't re-add it.
   **Staging added (2026-07-01)** — Ben flagged the sandbox-Paddle case: webhooks need a stable deployed
   URL (not local `vercel dev`) and sandbox test events must never touch production subscription data.
   `live/staging/terragrunt.hcl` is a Vercel **custom environment** (branch-tracked on `staging`) within
   the SAME project — not a second project. `modules/stack/vercel-env-vars.tf` now implements the full
   `is_prod`/`has_staging` split from `terraform.md`: production's manual secrets go `sensitive=true`
   / `target=["production"]` only (now that staging exists to cover preview/development); staging's stay
   non-sensitive (Vercel can't pull sensitive vars for preview/dev — the convention deliberately keeps
   these pullable so `vercel env pull` can fetch real sandbox values for local testing).
   **Correction (2026-07-01):** briefly second-guessed this into `target=["preview"]` +
   `git_branch="staging"` based on my own read of the generic `vercel/terraform-provider-vercel` docs
   (worried `target`/`custom_environment_ids` don't narrow each other) — Ben caught it and pointed back
   at `terraform.md`'s own documented shape, which already answers this (`target=["preview","development"]`
   **+** `custom_environment_ids`, exactly what was there originally). Reverted to the skill's convention
   as written — it's the org's vetted pattern, not something to relitigate from generic docs mid-task.
   Re-verified clean: production `9 to add`, staging `10 to add`.
   `PADDLE_ENVIRONMENT` (`"production"`/`"sandbox"`) is TF-managed, not a manual secret — it's fully
   determined by which stack this is, not external secret material. Cognito is NOT duplicated for
   staging (`infra/coldstorage` has no staging tier) — both stacks read the same production Cognito
   outputs; auth isn't what's being sandboxed.
   **Vercel link/pull wired (2026-07-01)** — `task link`/`task pull` (generic pickers, `select`+`case`,
   matching the `tf:plan`/`tf:apply`/`tf:init` picker convention added the same day) and their direct
   `link:account-backend`/`pull:account-backend` forms. `pull` writes `account-backend/.env.vercel`
   (bare `vercel env pull` defaults to the `development` target, which by construction only resolves to
   staging's non-sensitive values — production's are `sensitive=true` and don't target `development` at
   all, so there's no accidental-prod-pull path, no flags needed). `backend:dev`/`backend:db:push` load
   `.env.vercel` then `.env` via `bun --env-file` (later wins) — `.env` is an optional local override on
   top of the pulled staging baseline, never auto-loaded by bun/drizzle-kit/`vercel dev` on its own for a
   non-standard filename like this, hence the explicit flags. **Tried for real 2026-07-02** — Ben ran
   `task link` → `task pull` → `task backend:db:push` on his Mac against the staging Neon branch; the
   whole chain works (this was the step that stood the staging DB up).
   **Infra APPLIED for real (confirmed 2026-07-01 via `terragrunt state list`)** — both stacks are live,
   not just plan-clean: production shows all 9 resources in state (the OIDC role +
   `coldstorage-account-backend-production-vercel`, the 5 TF-managed vars, the 3 manual-secret
   placeholders), staging shows all 10 (same set + the `staging` custom environment); re-plans on both
   come back "No changes." This must have been run directly by Ben — not by me (I don't run `apply`).
   **Staging lane STOOD UP end-to-end (2026-07-02, Ben-executed; the four ex-blockers are done):**
   Neon project created (staging DB; schema pushed via `task link`/`pull`/`backend:db:push` — the
   pull mechanics verified for real); Paddle **sandbox** account live with the product catalog
   (3 tiers × 4 term prices at the NEW no-multi-year-discount pricing — see `strategy/SPEC.md` §5,
   re-decided 2026-07-01: terms are exactly N× the yearly rate, multi-year = rate-lock, not discount),
   a zero-permission API key, and a webhook destination for the nine `subscription.*` events pointed
   at `https://api-staging.coldstorage.sh/webhooks/paddle`; staging's 3 Vercel secrets set for real
   (production's 3 remain `SET_IN_VERCEL_DASHBOARD` placeholders until a LIVE Paddle account + prod
   Neon branch exist — that's the deferred production lane, nothing blocks on it). First `staging`
   push deployed — and crashed twice, same root cause: Vercel's zero-config Hono build transpiles
   per-file (NO bundling), so source must be valid runtime Node ESM — tsconfig `~/*` aliases don't
   exist at runtime, and neither do extensionless relative imports. Fixed for good (`3352384` +
   `55a5769`): relative imports with `.js` extensions + tsconfig on `module`/`moduleResolution`
   `nodenext`, which makes an extensionless relative import a hard `tsc` error — `task
   backend:typecheck` is itself the regression guard (verified: stripping one extension fails TS2307).
   **Staging VERIFIED LIVE (2026-07-02):** Vercel Authentication disabled (endpoints are
   self-securing — Cognito JWT / Paddle HMAC); smoke-tested from outside: `GET /` serves the health
   text, unsigned `POST /webhooks/paddle` → 400 (HMAC guard), tokenless `/entitlement` + `/key-blob`
   → 401. **Gate test PASSED (2026-07-02):** Paddle simulator (`subscription.activated` with
   `custom_data.cognitoSub` edited into the payload — note the simulator only lets you edit AFTER a
   first run: Payload tab → click to edit → Replay) delivered 200 and flipped `subscriptionActive`
   in the staging DB, confirmed by Ben in the Neon console — "webhook flips state" proven with zero
   checkout UI. "Upload blocked when inactive" (the daemon consuming `/entitlement`) rides with
   Phase 5's auth handoff.
5. **App auth + paywall UX — IN PROGRESS (started 2026-07-02).** Passwordless sign-in/up (Google via
   Cognito managed login in the SYSTEM browser — Google blocks embedded webviews — code+PKCE to the
   `coldstorage://` callback; email-OTP codes via `ALLOW_USER_AUTH` as the no-Google path) +
   recovery-code capture + subscribe flow in the Electron UI; token handed to the daemon. Cut
   hardest-first into three gated sub-steps (research pass 2026-07-02 verified every endpoint shape
   against current AWS/Electron/Paddle docs before building):
   - **5a — auth steel thread: BUILT ✅ (2026-07-02; `ui:typecheck` green, 64 ui tests green, TF plan
     surgical). LIVE gate is Ben's (below).** The riskiest slice end-to-end: system browser →
     managed-login PKCE (S256; RFC 7636 vector-tested) → redirect → code exchange → tokens → daemon
     `authenticate`. New `ui/src/main/auth/` (pkce/oauth/loopback/manager/config/ipc): access+ID
     tokens in main-process MEMORY only, refresh token safeStorage-encrypted (Keychain; keytar is
     dead/archived) in `userData/auth.json`, auto-refresh 5 min before the 1-h expiry, every fresh ID
     token (sign-in + refresh + daemon reconnect) re-runs `authenticate` so the daemon's Cognito
     logins never go stale. **Redirects, two lanes:** packaged = `coldstorage://auth/callback` deep
     link (electron-builder `protocols` → CFBundleURLTypes; `open-url` registered pre-ready + buffered
     — a URL can LAUNCH the app); dev = `http://localhost:53682/auth/callback` one-shot 127.0.0.1
     listener, because an UNPACKAGED Electron on macOS physically can't receive custom-scheme links
     (no Info.plist entry — Electron docs are explicit). Duplicate/foreign callbacks dropped by
     `state`-match against the single pending attempt (also the CSRF guard). Renderer: `AuthStatus`
     over IPC (never a token), sign-in gate view + Settings account card; dogfood installs
     (`configured: false`) see zero auth UI, byte-for-byte the old behavior. Infra: callback list +
     `cognito_domain` output (plan verified **0 add / 1 change / 0 destroy**; also pinned the six
     AWS-computed Google `provider_details` keys that were causing perpetual plan drift); handoff →
     `ui:config`/`ui:dev`/`ui:live` now carry `COLDSTORE_COGNITO_DOMAIN`/`_CLIENT_ID` (dev lanes strip
     the daemon secrets). **5a gate — MET ✅ (2026-07-02):** Ben signed in with Google and deposited a
     file that landed under his per-user prefix in the production vault; `task daemon:gate-test` then
     proved the boundary adversarially (own-prefix PUT ok, cross-prefix PUT + GET of Ben's real object
     both `AccessDenied`) — this also closes Phase 2's outstanding LIVE gate. **War story:** sign-in hung
     because VS Code's devcontainer auto-forwarded the dev loopback port (it printed `localhost:53682`
     in a terraform plan) and squatted `127.0.0.1:53682` on the Mac, black-holing the OAuth redirect;
     fixed with `devcontainer.json` `portsAttributes` (`onAutoForward: ignore`) + a fail-loud bind in
     `manager.signIn` (binds the listener BEFORE opening the browser). **Decided alongside:**
     dogfood→multi-user is a clean RESET, not a migration (`task daemon:reset:{local,vault}`) — the
     pre-auth archive at `blobs/<hash>` is unreachable from a Cognito identity anyway, so no S3
     re-prefix / journal-rewrite / key-rewrap migration is needed.
   - **5b — email-OTP lane + signup + recovery code + ZK wiring (IN PROGRESS, started 2026-07-02).**
     Re-sliced hardest-first: the ZK vault spine is the load-bearing part, so it goes first and is
     provable through the *existing* Google sign-in; email-OTP is genuinely independent scope (5b-3).
     **Architecture decision (2026-07-02):** all ZK crypto stays in Swift/libsodium (daemon-side); the
     app orchestrates + escrows. The daemon's `keys` is now a `SwappableKeyProvider` (lock-guarded
     `@unchecked Sendable`, shared by BOTH engines by reference — same trick as CognitoAuth's resolver):
     dogfood mode seeds it from the local file KEK (byte-for-byte unchanged), multi-user mode starts
     LOCKED so `userKEK()` throws `.vaultLocked` and a deposit before unlock fails clean — the crypto
     analogue of the identity pool gating S3.
     - **5b-1 — daemon vault core: DONE ✅ (2026-07-02, 83 Core tests green + `ui:typecheck`/66 ui
       tests green).** `SwappableKeyProvider` + `.vaultLocked` (`Crypto.swift`); `mintRecoveryOnly`
       (passwordless — recovery code is the sole lock; password slot is a real wrap under a random
       discarded secret, keeping the KeyBlob shape + the backend's not-null columns intact) +
       `generateRecoveryCode` (25 chars Crockford base32, ~125 bits, `XXXXX-…` grouped)
       (`ZeroKnowledgeKeys.swift`); four control commands gated on `cognitoAuth != nil` — `mintVault`
       (returns blob-to-store + one-time code + MK-to-escrow), `unlockVault {masterKey}` (day-to-day
       from the app's cache), `unlockVaultWithRecoveryCode {keyBlob…, recoveryCode}` (new device,
       returns MK), `lockVault` (sign-out) — all key material over the LOCAL socket only, never the
       network. `main.swift` builds the provider seeded/locked by mode; `protocol.ts` mirrors the DTOs.
       *Gate met:* unit tests — locked provider throws `.vaultLocked`, unlock round-trips a real DEK
       through the exact `EnvelopeCipher`, wrong recovery code fails closed, mint MK == recovery-unlock
       MK, seeded (dogfood) provider never gates.
     - **5b-2 — app vault orchestration + recovery-code UI: DONE ✅ (2026-07-02, `ui:typecheck` +
       72 ui tests green).** New `ui/src/main/vault/` (keyblob-client/storage/manager/config/ipc): the
       `VaultManager` runs after `authenticate` in the daemon handoff and decides per-device — cached MK
       (safeStorage, keyed by `sub`) → `unlockVault` (silent, the day-to-day + reconnect path); no cache
       + 404 key-blob → `mintVault` → PUT the blob + escrow the MK + show the one-time recovery code;
       no cache + existing blob → NEW device → prompt → `unlockVaultWithRecoveryCode`. Backend key-blob
       client maps the `wrappedMk`↔`wrappedMK` casing at the one boundary; base URL defaults to the
       staging lane (accepts production Cognito tokens, so this works end-to-end today). Renderer sees
       only `VaultStatus` over IPC (never key material except the one-time code): reducer/controller
       fold + `views/RecoveryCodeView.tsx` (show-once, enter-code, provisioning/error gates) wired into
       `App.tsx`'s gate. Sign-out relocks the daemon but KEEPS the per-device escrow (`vault.json`,
       re-signin is silent); `task daemon:sim-new-device` deletes just that escrow to force the
       recovery-code path. Tests: `VaultManager` cached/mint/new-device/error/relock branches headless +
       the vault-status fold. **Gate (Ben, Mac) — the real ZK proof:** fresh Google sign-in → recovery
       code shown once → a deposit; then `task daemon:sim-new-device` (deletes the MasterKey escrow, no
       second Mac needed) → relaunch → sign-in prompts for the recovery code → same files decrypt. The
       deposit's blob must be openable with the MK and NOT with a random key (that crypto is already
       unit-proven in 5b-1; the app gate is what 5b-2 adds).
     - **5b-3 — email-OTP sign-in + signup lane:** the independent auth lane (Cognito USER_AUTH via
       plain HTTPS), a second entry on the sign-in screen; feeds the same token/vault machinery.
     Verified shapes for 5b-3: `SignUp`
     with NO password is first-class for passwordless pools; `ConfirmSignUp`'s `Session` feeds
     `InitiateAuth USER_AUTH` so signup costs the user exactly ONE emailed code; sign-in =
     `InitiateAuth` + `PREFERRED_CHALLENGE: EMAIL_OTP` → `RespondToAuthChallenge` — all callable as
     plain unauthenticated HTTPS JSON-RPC (`X-Amz-Target`), no AWS SDK in the app. Plus the ZK leg:
     daemon key-blob mint/unlock commands wiring `UserMasterKeyProvider` (today `coldstored` still
     uses `LocalFileKEK`), recovery-code capture UI, key-blob GET/PUT against the backend, Keychain
     MK caching, and a daemon sign-out/deauth command (today the daemon keeps its STS creds + prefix
     until expiry after an app-side sign-out). *Gate:* fresh email signs up with one code, recovery
     code shown once, key-blob lands server-side, deposit encrypts under the unlocked MK.
   - **5c — paywall + subscribe (Paddle).** Decided pattern (verified vs Paddle docs 2026-07-02):
     backend `POST /checkout-session` creates the transaction server-side (`POST /transactions` with
     `custom_data: {cognitoSub}` — the ONLY way to guarantee custom_data; it propagates to the
     subscription and its webhooks) → app opens **Paddle-hosted checkout** (`pay.paddle.io/...?
     transaction_id=…`, redirect URL supports custom schemes) in the system browser → app polls
     `/entitlement` (webhook is the source of truth; the `coldstorage://checkout-complete` redirect is
     just a check-now nudge). Deposit gate on `/entitlement` in the app layer. Sandbox test card
     `4242 4242 4242 4242`; `4000 0027 6000 3184` tests the renewal-decline/revoke path. *Gate:*
     sandbox checkout flips entitlement, upload gate opens.
6. **Sign + notarize + ship** — Developer ID signing + notarization + auto-update + download page. *Gate:*
   a notarized build launches Gatekeeper-clean on a non-dev Mac and self-updates.

## Open sub-decisions (don't block P1; flagged for when their phase lands)
- ~~**Encryption password vs auth credential** — with a federated login there is no password to derive
  KEK_pw from.~~ **DECIDED ✅ (2026-07-02), forced universal by going passwordless:** option (b),
  **recovery-code-only** — the recovery code is the sole MK protector (`wrappedMK_rc`; the `wrappedMK_pw`
  slot goes unused), each signed-in device caches MK in the macOS Keychain (no prompt at launch), a new
  device unwraps with the recovery code, and any signed-in device can reissue a fresh code by re-wrapping.
  See the revised key-hierarchy diagram in §Architecture. Primitives unchanged — `ZeroKnowledgeKeys`
  built both paths; we wire only the rc path in P5.
- ~~**Argon2id library** for Swift (swift-sodium vs a focused Argon2 wrapper) — P3.~~ **DECIDED ✅
  (2026-07-01): swift-sodium.** See Phase 3 above.
- ~~**Account backend shape** (Lambda+APIGW+DynamoDB vs a managed app) — P4.~~ **DECIDED ✅ (2026-07-01):
  Hono on Vercel + Neon/Drizzle.** See Phase 4.
- **Apple Sign-in prerequisites** — Apple Developer Services ID + key (Ben provides) — var-gated off,
  optional post-launch (email-OTP + Google cover sign-in without it).
- ~~**Google IdP prerequisites** — OAuth client, SSM creds, enable flag.~~ **DONE ✅ (2026-07-02): Google
  sign-in is LIVE at the Cognito layer.** OAuth client created (Web application; redirect URI =
  the Cognito domain's `/oauth2/idpresponse`), creds in SSM via `task tf:coldstorage:google-creds`,
  `enable_google_idp = true` applied (Google IdP + hosted-UI domain
  `coldstorage-production-731520377763` + OAuth client config). Smoke-tested: `/oauth2/authorize?...
  identity_provider=Google` 302s to accounts.google.com with the full client id. (War story: the first
  apply stored client_id `1000` — the creds task had used `read GID`, and GID is a READONLY built-in
  (the unix group id) in go-task's mvdan/sh; renamed vars + shape guards now prevent that class.)
  Remaining for P5 (app side): system-browser flow + `coldstorage://auth/callback` handling in Electron.
- **Free trial / plan tiers / retrieval-fee charging** — product/economics (private `strategy/`) — P4.
- **[open] Same-email, two sign-in methods = two Cognito accounts.** A Google-federated user and an
  email-OTP user with the SAME address are separate profiles (separate `sub`s → separate key-blobs,
  separate S3 prefixes — under ZK they can't see each other's data) unless linked server-side
  (`AdminLinkProviderForUser`, which must run BEFORE the federated first sign-in — a pre-signup
  Lambda). Surfaced by the 2026-07-02 research pass. Leaning: ship 5a/5b unlinked with plain copy
  ("sign in the way you signed up"), decide linking before public launch — but this is Ben's call.
- **[open] Daemon-side sign-out** — app sign-out revokes tokens + drops the session, but the daemon
  holds its STS creds/prefix until expiry (~1h). A `deauthenticate` control command rides with 5b.
