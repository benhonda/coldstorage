# Packaging ColdStorage.app

## Why this exists

`coldstored` currently installs as an **unbundled** Mach-O binary via a LaunchAgent (`task daemon:install`).
macOS TCC labels unbundled path-clients by their **executable filename** — so users see "coldstored", not
"ColdStorage", and the grant is brittle (re-signing/rebuilding orphans it; the `-10814` gotcha). Only a
proper `.app` bundle gets a `CFBundleDisplayName` + icon + a stable bundle id. So: package the app (#1),
then move the daemon inside it as an SMAppService helper (#2).

## What's scaffolded here

- `electron-builder.yml` — appId `com.theadpharm.coldstorage`, productName **ColdStorage**, mac target
  (dmg + zip), hardened runtime, entitlements, and the release Swift binaries bundled to
  `Contents/Resources/bin/`. (electron-builder **v26** syntax — signing fields top-level under `mac`.)
- `build/entitlements.mac.plist` — hardened-runtime entitlements Electron needs (JIT heap, dyld env,
  library-validation off); deliberately **not** sandboxed (the app opens the unix control socket + spawns
  the bundled helpers).
- `task ui:package` — builds release Swift binaries → `electron-vite build` → `electron-builder --mac`.
- `main/system.ts` resolves `coldstore-photo-picker` from `Contents/Resources/bin` when `app.isPackaged`.

## Build it (on your Mac)

```
task ui:package      # → ui/dist/ColdStorage.app + .dmg + .zip
```

Unsigned/unnotarized by default, so it runs locally without certs. To produce a **distributable**:

## Before it's shippable — the Mac-iteration TODOs

These genuinely need on-device iteration (can't be done/verified off a Mac):

1. **Icon** — add `build/icon.icns` (1024px, from the Design System). Without it electron-builder uses its
   stock Electron icon. *This is also the icon users will see in the Photos privacy list.*
2. **Signing + notarization** — set `mac.notarize: true` and provide a **Developer ID Application** cert +
   notary creds (`APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, or an API key). Use a STABLE
   identity — the Photos TCC grant is keyed to it (same constraint `daemon:install` already documents).
3. **Verify nested-binary signing** — confirm electron-builder signs the bundled Swift binaries under
   `Contents/Resources/bin` with hardened runtime. `coldstored` already carries its `-sectcreate` Info.plist
   (Photos usage string); confirm that survives the re-sign.

## Step #2 — app owns its daemon (approach **B**): CONNECT ✅, IDENTITY ❌

We rejected SMAppService (`SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` must run in the app's main-bundle context; our
main process is Electron/Node → needs a native addon). Instead the **packaged app owns its daemon**: it
spawns `coldstored` as a child, supervises it (KeepAlive-style restart), kills it on quit. Tradeoff: the
daemon runs while the app runs (menu-bar/Backblaze model), not as an independent launchd service.

**Wired + PROVEN on a real Mac (2026-06-28) — the app reaches "connected":** (`main/daemon.ts` + `main/index.ts`)
- Spawn/supervise the bundled `coldstored` (packaged only); per-user data dir = `app.getPath("userData")`
  (`~/Library/Application Support/ColdStorage` — same `DATA_DIR` `task daemon:logs` tails).
- Socket SSOT: `daemonSocketPath()` feeds both the daemon's `COLDSTORE_SOCKET` and `new DaemonClient({…})`,
  so the packaged app dials the child it just launched (this is what fixed "Connecting…").
- `app.setName("ColdStorage")` pins userData so the client's (module-load) and daemon's (whenReady) socket
  paths can't diverge; `app.setLoginItemSettings({ openAtLogin: true })` for reboot persistence.

### Identity — UNRESOLVED (the original "coldstored" screenshot is still open)

The premise that a child inherits the app's TCC identity via **responsible-process attribution was WRONG**
in practice: the on-device test (2026-06-28) still showed `coldstored` in System Settings ▸ Privacy &
Security ▸ Photos, not "ColdStorage". A plain child keeps its OWN identity (it has its own signature +
embedded Info.plist). Compounding it, the test build is **ad-hoc** signed, which gives TCC an unstable,
filename-defaulted identity regardless — so a clean verdict isn't even possible until proper signing.

**Untested caveat:** unconfirmed whether a fresh Photos *prompt* actually fired during the test, or whether
the pane just showed the stale entry from the old `daemon:install`. Worth re-checking on a signed build.

Options for when we return to this (need a **properly signed** build to evaluate any of them):
1. **Native disclaim-responsibility launcher** — a tiny shim that `posix_spawn`s `coldstored` with
   `responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim(…, 1)` so its responsible process becomes the app. The documented
   way a helper shares the app's TCC identity. (Native code — the thing B was meant to avoid.)
2. **Embedded-Info.plist experiment (cheapest)** — set `CFBundleName=ColdStorage` (+ identifier + icon) in
   `coldstored`'s `-sectcreate` Info.plist and see if TCC shows it. Unverified; try first on a signed build.
3. **SMAppService** via a small Swift registration helper or native addon — the "proper" route we deferred.

**Recommendation (2026-06-28):** the label is cosmetic for self-dogfooding and un-judgeable on an ad-hoc
build — defer it to the signing milestone. Prioritize the two things that block actually USING the app:

**Still to do (own milestones):**
- **Production AWS credentials** for a Finder-launched app (inherits no shell env) — the daemon starts +
  serves the socket without them, but **uploads can't complete**. This is the real blocker to dogfooding.
  Likely a bundled credential flow / config file. ← **next priority**
- **Real code signing** (Developer ID / the Apple Development cert `daemon:install` already uses) — needed
  for arm64 launch beyond the ad-hoc stopgap, for the grant to persist across rebuilds, AND to even judge
  the identity options above. Confirm electron-builder signs `Contents/Resources/bin/*` (may need `mac.binaries`).
- **Background-run UX** — a **Tray** + `LSUIElement` so the always-running app lives in the menu bar, plus a
  Settings toggle for `openAtLogin`. Pairs with a UX session.
- **Delete the `photos-spike` TCC entry** — dev cruft visible in the same pane.

## Related runtime wiring still on dev paths

- `main/system.ts` prefers the bundled picker when packaged; `coldstore-restore` follows the same
  `process.resourcesPath/bin` pattern when the restore flow is wired into the packaged app.
