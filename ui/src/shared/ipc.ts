/**

 * owns the one {@link DaemonClient} and the unix socket — and the renderer, which never touches the
 * socket and only sees the narrow {@link ColdstoreApi} the preload exposes on `window.coldstore`.
 *
 * Two directions:
 *   - commands  renderer → main → daemon : one invoke channel ({@link IPC.request}), id-multiplexed
 *               request/response handled by the layer-1 client. Typed end-to-end via {@link Commands}.
 *   - pushes    main → renderer          : daemon events ({@link IPC.event}) and connection lifecycle
 *               ({@link IPC.lifecycle}), broadcast to every window's webContents.
 *
 * Daemon wire types are re-exported here so the renderer binds to ONE seam (never reaches into
 * `daemon/`, which is main-process-only). They're type-only — `protocol.ts` has zero runtime/Node deps.
