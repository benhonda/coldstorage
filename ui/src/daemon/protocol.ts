/**
 * Wire contract for the `coldstored` control plane — a TypeScript MIRROR of the Swift SSOT.
 * Do not invent shapes here; these track the daemon's own definitions and must stay in lockstep:
 *
 *   - Envelopes  → `Sources/ColdStorageCore/ControlProtocol.swift`
 *   - Commands   → `DaemonService.handle` (the command SSOT) + its result DTOs
 *   - Events     → `DaemonEvent(...)` call sites across `DaemonService`
 *
 * Transport is newline-delimited JSON over a unix socket: one `ControlRequest` per line out; one
 * line per message back — a reply (carries `id`) or a pushed event (carries `event`). The client
 * tells them apart by which key is present (see {@link isResponseLine}/{@link isEventLine}).
 *
 * On the wire every param/event value is a STRING (Swift `[String: String]`), even numbers like
 * `days` ("7") or `filesTotal` ("42"). Result DTOs are richer JSON (numbers/bools) — typed per DTO.
